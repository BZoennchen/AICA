        "- **Metadata** (`MAMe_dataset.csv`): the museum provenance, the widht, height, product size, and aspect ratio.\n",
        "- **The artistic medium** (`MAMe_labels.csv`): 29 categories of artistic medium (i.e. materials and techniques), such as \"oil on canvas\", \"painting\", \"photograph\", \"ceramic\", etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, we provide the file `MAMe_dataset_extended.csv`, which is similar to `MAMe_dataset.csv` but we added an extra column that contains the MobileNetV1 features for each image. [MobileNetV1](https://paperswithcode.com/method/mobilenetv1) is a generalist and pre-trained neural network specialized to extract visual features. It has been trained on 1000 categories of images from the ImageNet dataset."
