# Tools, Libraries and Frameworks

## General Tools

### Neural Numers

A visualization of feedforward neural networks (FNN) on the basis of hand written number classification.

Online Version: [Neural Numers](https://imaginary.github.io/neural-numbers/index.html)

## Sound & Music

### Piano Genie

*Piano Genie* is an intelligent controller which allows non-musicians to improve on the piano.
A user performs on a simple interface with eight buttons, and their performance is decoded into the space of plausible piano music in real time.
The software is based on a musically constraint **recurrent neural network (RNN) autoencoder**.

### ScaleLab

A simple tool to learn the very basics of what sound is via the harmonic series.

### SpectrumAnalyser

An online spectrum analyser.
Works with your microphone.

Online Version: [SpectrumAnalyser](https://imaginary.github.io/SpectrumAnalyser/)

### Teachable Machine

Classification of sound.
One can train a classifier to distinguish between different sound sources, e.g. different instruments.

### Tone Transfer

*Tone Transfer* is part of the [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) Google research project.
It can be used to transfer the tone of one instrument/voice to another, very similar to the technique called *style transfer* in the area of image processing.

### Magenta

[Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) is a Google research project.
Google offer ready to use tools to play with (**high-level**) but also an interface if one wants to dive deeper and use coding to communicate with the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library (**low-level**).
